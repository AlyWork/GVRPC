    <h3>COVID-19</h3>
    <h5>Vaccination Information</h5>
    <p>GVRPC is committed to our Residents,Staff and community during the Pandemic, and continues to provide the most current information about the COVID-19 Vaccine and has implemented guidelines at all our properties to help prevent the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Vaccines are available at pharmacies, hospitals and through local health departments statewide – please contact your provider of choice to schedule your vaccine appointment. Additionally, there is a network of State-run sites distributing vaccine statewide – to determine eligibility and schedule appointments at <strong>New York State-run vaccination sites only</strong> visit the Am I Eligible app.</p>
    <p>Successful completion of the Am I Eligible App does not guarantee you access to a vaccine. As New York State receives additional allocations from the Federal Government, more New Yorkers will be eligible and the Am I Eligible App will be updated. You can recheck your eligibility at any time.</p>
    <p>You must bring proof of eligibility to your appointment. This may include an employee ID card, a letter from an employer or affiliated organization, or a pay stub, depending on the specific priority status. If you are eligible because of your age, bring a government-issued ID that includes your date of birth (like a Driver’s License or passport).</p>
    <button class="btn btn-success eligibility">SEE IF YOU ARE ELIGIBLE</button>
    <h5>Process and Immune Response</h5>
    <p>Both the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines require two shots.</p>
    <h6>Immunity</h6>
    <p>Researchers do not yet know how long immunity after vaccination lasts. That’s why you must continue to wear a mask, wash your hands regularly and social distance.</p>
    <h6>Potential Side Effects after the Vaccination</h6>
    <p>You may not notice any changes in how you feel after getting the shot. But it’s also possible to feel a little “under the weather.” This can happen after any vaccine. It is the body’s immune response to getting vaccinated and a sign that the vaccine is starting to work.</p>
    <p>After the COVID-19 vaccine, you may have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A sore arm where you got the shot</li>
      <li>A headache</li>
      <li>Chills</li>
      <li>Fever</li>
      <li>Tiredness</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Over the counter pain relievers and fever reducers may help. You should feel better in a day or two. If you still don't feel well after two or three days, talk to your health care provider.</p>
